src/pages/AssetAllocationProjectionPage.tsx(597,48): error TS2352: Conversion of type '{ loanType_id: undefined; loanAmount: undefined; startDate: undefined; totalMonths: undefined; emi: undefined; liability_id?: number; prepaymentExpected: number; comment: string; }' to type 'LiabilityProjection' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Property 'id' is missing in type '{ loanType_id: undefined; loanAmount: undefined; startDate: undefined; totalMonths: undefined; emi: undefined; liability_id?: number; prepaymentExpected: number; comment: string; }' but required in type 'LiabilityProjection'.
